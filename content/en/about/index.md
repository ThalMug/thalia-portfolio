# Who am I?

My name is Thalia Meignan, a video games and music enthusiast since my early years as well as a programming passionate. I started my journey as a game creator by composing original music during game jams and learning diverse game engines such as Unity, Unreal or Godot.

# Game Creation
{.text-center}
#### My initial experiences with Unity sparkled a deeper interest in game development, leading me to study video games at UQAC. My academic background taught me a lot about programming, game development processes and game engines in general. Previously I was also part of ENSEIRB-MATMECA's Game Creation Club (GCC).

# Music

#### I regularly compose music in my free time. I play the guitar, drums, a bit of piano/trumpet and I compose using FL Studio. You can find some of my composition and covers [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-794926574).
